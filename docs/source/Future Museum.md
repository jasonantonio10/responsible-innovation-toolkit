This is a game tool that I designed for you to help you practice responsible innovation\. The game is called Future Museum, and it is a team\-based game that aims to make you review your technology project from a future perspective and think about its long\-term impact on society and environment\.

## Benefits

- It can help you enhance your sense of responsibility and ethical awareness, and let you consider the positive and negative impacts of your technology on future society and environment, and how to prevent or mitigate potential risks and harms\.
- It can help you improve your communication and collaboration skills, and let you share and present your technology project with other teams, and accept their questions, feedbacks, and ratings\.
- It can help you improve your imagination and creativity, and let you envision the possibilities and scenarios of your technology in the future\.

## Preparing

- Determine the number and grouping of participants, suggest each team has 3 to 5 people, each team chooses a technology project that they are developing or planning to develop\.
- Determine the time and place for the game, suggest each team has 30 to 60 minutes to design their exhibit, and play the game in a space that is suitable for presentation and interaction\.

The players are expected to go through the following steps in this game:

- Each team imagines how their technology project will evolve and apply in the next 50 years and designs an exhibit for it that will be displayed in the future museum, including the name, introduction, picture, video, etc\. of the exhibit\.
- Each team shows their exhibit to other teams and explains the positive and negative impacts of their technology project on future society and environment, and how they prevent or mitigate potential risks and harms\.
- Other teams can ask questions or give feedbacks, and give ratings, the rating criteria include innovation, feasibility, responsibility, etc\.

## Discussion

- Each team summarizes the areas that need improvement or attention for their technology project based on other teamsâ€™ ratings and feedbacks, and what they learned from this game\.
